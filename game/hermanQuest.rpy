    "Grasping the beautifully polished handle and pushing the door open, the atmosphere feels inviting: gentle embers in the fireplace, tables sparkling and neatly arranged for a dinner party, and numerous bottles of various shapes and sizes on the shelves behind the bar."
    "Despite the grandeur, only one person sits in a chair near the middle of the room in a neatly pressed pin-stripe suit, making himself seen as he taps his foot to the music, pen in hand, his gaze fixated on a booklet."

    he "Oh!... OH!... Oh, LORD, that's the best thing I've heard in a LONG time. WhoooooWEEE, that's a good story, I tell you what!"
    "He slowly wipes tears from his eyes, his laughter calming a bit as he slaps you firmly on the back."
    "My friend, you've given me a wonderful present - the gift of laughter! Imagine that: a \"super\" woman so small you can carry her around in your pocket, knows everything in the world AND just by tapping her she can talk to ANYONE."
    "That's straight out of them \"science fiction\" novels like 'Metropolis' I've heard about."
    "As Herman continues to chuckle a bit, he adjusts his monocle, dusts his suit off, then collects his things and pops his cigar back in his mouth, taking a seat in his chair once again to resume his writing."
    "\"That's it? You just shrug it off as if it means nothing?!\""
    "\"What else would convince you?\""

    "Herman's eyes furrow. He tosses his pen and booklet on the table, then yanks the paper from your hands, but it crumbles to dust in his fingers."
    "He stands and looks down upon you with contempt, his hands held in the air."

    "He shakes his hands off a bit, then wipes his hands on your shirt."

    he "Doesn't seem like much evidence to me, does it? Better luck next time, young'n."
    "He pats you on the shoulder, though more so to finish wiping his hands clean with a snarky smile before returning to his seat, grabbing his pen and booklet to continue writing."
    "\"That's it? You just shrug it off as if it means nothing?!\""
    "\"What else would convince you?\""

    "Herman looks up at the ceiling for a few moments, then back at you."

    he "Now, don't you think I would have done this myself if I really thought I wasn't alive no more?"
    "He smirks and shakes his head."
    "Come on now, if this is supposedly your 'task,' I would have thought you would be better at it."
    "Herman's smirk slides into a grin as he chuckles, looking back to his work."
    "If ya ain't got nothing else to jaw on about, then get. I've got to finish this speech, and your tom-foolery is distracting me."
    "Ask Herman questions."
    "Leave."

    "Herman's gaze darts to yours, staring you dead in the eyes. He slowly puts his booklet down and points his pen at you like a sharp extension of his finger."

    he "Now you look here, young'n, I ain't got TIME for your mess'n 'round, ya hear?"
    "He stands up abruptly, walks up to you, and pokes his finger into your shoulder, stabbing you slightly with the tip of his fountain pen."

    he "My patience is wearin' thin, little rabbit, so if you dun watch that mouth'a yours, I'll skin ya and mount that thick skull on the wall."

    he "Are we CRYSTAL clear on this?"
    "He curls his hand into a fist and shoves you backwards a bit, eyeballing you as he sits back down with a thud in his chair and yanks his booklet back up, returning to writing."
    "Ask Herman questions."
    "Leave."

    "Something in this mansion should be able to prove Herman has died."
    "Look in the Living Room; perhaps something there might help.`Player can search Living Room and find the photograph`"

    "As you search the living room, rummaging through old books, photo albums, and other random boxes, you discover an old photo of men in dark robes with hoods covering their faces, among some other pictures of Rory. However, the photo is heavily faded and appears to have cup ring stains on it, so it's impossible to see what the men look like."
    "A hole in the photo, seemingly from an open flame, goes right through the face of one of the hooded men."
    "Turning the photo over, written in faded ink, you can barely make out the words \"Acolytes of The Eater of Souls\" and various names."
    "The names listed are smudged and faded as well, but you can make out three of them."
    "E. O'Neal"
    "B. Indigo"
    "H. Grover"
    "H. Grover appears to have been scratched out. Perhaps this photo will help Herman see that even his club members realized he was gone?"
    "Search the Main Foyer, there has to be more."

    "As you look about at the random books and notes in the foyer, you almost trip over an old notebook. It stands out from the others due to the odd symbol on the cover and a clasp that holds it closed."
    "You fiddle with the clasp, checking for a lock, and it pops open."
    "Opening the book, the first few dozen pages are somewhat together, quite weathered and smudged, as if the book was sitting in water for a long time and then dried out. You're able to read some writing of the opening endpaper beside a curious symbol; \"The Jour... rutus Indi ...\"."
    "As you thumb through the pages, many entries talk exclusively about Herman: about how ruthless, evil, and nasty he is. How he cheated so many people through his policies and robbed others with underhanded business tactics."
    "Some entries discuss rituals, sacrifices to 'The Flaming One,' and this being's inevitable return."
    "Reading more, you come across a smudged entry that appears to be dated September 5th, 1922, that catches your eye."
    "\"... only two days before the next sacrifice, we have all agreed that a large offering to The Flaming One is required. I pray that The Son of Nodens will be long satiated with this ample offering.\""
    "What was Herman mixed up in? I need to see him right away."

    "With the old notebook and photograph in hand, you make your way back inside the lounge. The air is so thick with smoke now it would be almost impossible to breathe, if breathing was something you needed to worry about."
    "The smoke does not seem to leave the room, even with the door wide open. However, it has become rather hard to see, so much so that you can't even see your hand in front of your face."
    "\"Herman, I can't see through this smoke, where are you?\""

    "You see a dark figure moving towards you, merely a silhouette with piercing eyes that seem to burn through the smoke."
    "As the figure moves closer, you can see clearly that it's Herman. With a cigar between his teeth and a wide smile, he appears unphased by the smoke. He smacks you on the arm with his hand as if to greet you."

    he "Well now, it's good to see you back in one piece! Come, come, let's have a cigar and some of the gut-rot whiskey from the bar."
    "\"Rory, I can barely see through the smoke, but I discovered some things that might help.\""

    "Herman looks around, seemingly confused."
    "What smoke? There's no smoke in here."
    "As you look around, you see that, indeed, there is no smoke in the room at all anymore."
    "Regardless of this mystery, your task comes first. Herman must come to terms with his death."
    "Give Herman the old notebook and photograph."
    "\"Rory, I won't give you what I found, but we can talk about it.\""
    "\"You don't deserve to know anything. You were a horrible person in life and worse in death!\""

    "Herman lifts an eyebrow and takes the old notebook and picture, looking them over momentarily. He then flips through the pages of the notebook, tearing some recklessly in the process."
    "He waves the notebook and photograph carelessly at you."

    he "What kind'a nonsense is this? All ya bring me is a nasty ol' journal and a washed out photo? Is this some kinda trick?"
    "He looks over the photograph again, turning it over, and appears annoyed by what he sees."
    "If you're playin' games, this ain't funny."
    "\"No games, Rory. Do either of those help you to remember anything?\""

    "Herman smirks and folds his arms over his chest, shifting his cigar to the other side of his mouth."

    he "Talk about what? I don't even know whatcha got there, let alone what we got to talk about."
    "\"I have a notebook that talks about you and a photograph with your name on it.\""
    "\"What we have to talk about is: why are you in a photograph with cult members?\""

    "Herman rolls his eyes at you."

    he "What? Are ya on a toot or somethin'? Get your head outta your ass!"
    "He steps forward, glaring down at you."
    "You dunno your oats, young'n. I've done plenty for the folks 'round here! Go on and just poll them; I'm a shoe-in for the next election."
    "\"I'm not playing your games, Herman. You were in a cult. Explain that.\""
    "\"I have a notebook that talks about you and a photograph with your name on it.\""

    "Herman looks at the photograph once more, reading the back of it. Then, taking a better look at the journal, gently opens the book and looks through a few pages in more detail."
    "No... no, they wouldn't have."
    "He coughs as he continues to read, and you notice his feet slowly lift from the ground."
    "Ample sacrifice? Why would they... I was loyal for so long."
    "He drops the photo and notebook, lifting his hands to his face, and turns them over to look at the back of them."
    "\"Rory, you're floating... does that mean you've accepted your death?\""

    "Herman lifts his head and turns his gaze to the side slightly, looking down over his nose and trying to see what you have in your hands better, like a vulture sizing up a meal."
    "Someone wrote an article about me? A photo with my autograph? Well, this I gotta see!"
    "He suddenly snatches the notebook and photograph from your hands, looking at both intently well out of your reach."
    "Now wait a gosh darn minute. This looks like Brutus' journal. How did you get this from him?!"
    "\"Herman, I wanted to talk with you about those before I gave them to you!\""

    "Herman shakes his head at you, like a disappointed father."
    "The Acolytes of The Eater of Souls are not a 'cult,' little rabbit; they are a secret society who prevent the return of Vorvodoss, a being of immense power with an insatiable appetite for life essence."
    "He turns around and starts to pace the floor slowly, arms crossed tightly over his chest with one hand rubbing his beard."
    "Without our sacrifice of animals, Vorvodoss would claim a host to reign terror and death upon the living until his hunger is quenched. I paid the price to gain political power, like every other politician in history."
    "Herman stomps his foot on the floor, arms stretched wide, his eyes glassing over as if holding back tears."
    "I sacrificed my family farm! We produced livestock for the monthly rituals... They took all my family had."
    "But it STILL wasn't enough to keep those bastards from running my businesses and my name into the dirt! They forced me to levy taxes on essentials like groceries just so they could afford to bring in truckloads of cows, goats, and sheep!"
    "\"So you were just being used by them to kill animals for some made-up god?"
    "\"I don't believe anything you just said, Rory. You've been a lying cheat your whole life.\""

    "Herman ignores you, lifting his hand out in front of himself and pointing to the table. Without hesitation, the table careens across the floor and slams into the wall, breaking into a few large pieces."
    "I... I done did that. I wanted to break that damn ugly ass table."
    "`VO-SFX-chuckle` He slowly turns without moving his feet, suspended in the air, then points at the bottles behind the bar as if his hand and finger were a gun."

    he "Bang bang bang!"
    "`VO-SFX-glass shatter x3` Three more bottles burst with each of his words. He looks down at his hands again as he clenches them closed."
    "Oh, now this is TRUE power!"
    "\"Rory, this isn't about you gaining power. You're supposed to accept your death and move on to the afterlife!\""

    "Herman sighs and shrugs, stopping his pacing to look at you."
    "It dun'matter what you think or believe. I never believed it neither, but it was such a great deal on paper."
    "He uses his hands and balances them like a scale."
    "All I had to do was give them control of cattle processing and production. They'd give me 50% of the profits, AND they'd make me Governor, then Senator, then lastly..."
    "He raises his hand flat and slowly wipes it in the air to one side, looking up past you as he daydreams."
    "President of the U.S. of A."
    "He grins widely down at you, shaking both hands at you like an excited child getting the exact toy they asked for."
    "Wouldn't you do anything for that much power?!"
    "\"I was wrong, Rory. You're not evil; you're just a power-hungry idiot.\""

    "`VO-SFX-annoyed` Herman looks at you, shocked."
    "Now wait just a gosh darn minute, young'n, I..."
    "\"I think this cult was done with you. They were finished stealing your businesses. You enacted the policies they wanted, so they murdered you and sacrificed you.\""

    "Herman stops and looks at you. He seems to be thinking clearly."
    #voice heq2-55
    he "You know what? I honestly think you're right."
    "He looks at his hands, clenching and unclenching his right fist."

    he "I realize I've been missing somethin' important all this time. It would really help me come to terms with all of this mess."
    "Herman holds up the photograph and points to the hands of all the members, then holds up his own right hand and wiggles his fingers."
    "My signet ring. I can't believe I've forgotten, but this picture jogged my memory. That's the ring my pappy gave me, and I need it."
    "\"Where would I be able to find the ring?\""
    "\"Why the hell should I go on yet ANOTHER 'get this for me' trip?\""

    "Herman puts his hand over his heart and raises his hand."
    "I swear on my pappy's grave, I ain't telling no fib. I'm all but certain this is all I've been missing and what I need to get a move on myself."
    "`VO-SFX-annoyed`He smirks and shrugs purposefully slow."
    "Unless you're just that entertained by me. In that case, we can just play poker. I call Texas Hold'em; best out of five million games wins?"
    "Herman turns and grabs a deck of cards from a drawer, shuffling them with a big smile."
    "\"Fine. I'd rather play cards then get anything else for you.\""
    "\"I'll just go find that ring for you. Where would it be?\""

    "You play poker with Herman."
    "After a few hands, Herman having multiple cigars and numerous drinks, neither of you are ahead yet."
    "How about another hand? I'll go easy on you this time."
    "Keep playing poker."
    "\"Fine! I'll go find that ring for you. Where would it be?\""

    he "Head on down to the basement. That's where the rituals were held here. I doubt those yella bellied cowards would have had the gall to clean up afterwards."
    "It feels off to say this, but once I have my old ring back, I think that'll help me pass on."
    "Herman glances at his hands again, then turns his back on you to look around the room, ignoring you."
    "Head to the Science Lab."

    "As you look carefully through random bits of old broken glass, junk, and boxes, you notice something carved into the floor. Though heavily worn, it looks similar to the symbol from the notebook."
    "You sift through decades of dust, grime, and old ashes, but finally, you see something glint. Lifting up the jewel captured in a ring, the obvious charred and mummified remains of a human finger stuck to the insides. The ring, despite the heat, appears pristine."
    "Head back to Herman with the ring."
