    "Hey! My name is Marie Minuet, and I'm one of the writers crafting the story for \“The House On Limbo Lane\", and it has been a remarkable journey!"
    "Currently, I'm pursuing my degree in clinical psychology, specializing in behavioral analysis. Beyond my academic pursuits, my heart belongs to the world of storytelling and my video game addiction."
    "What truly fuels my passion is creating narratives that not only entertain and keep our attention but also resonate deeply with our emotions and experiences."
    "\"The House On Limbo Lane\" marks an incredible milestone for me—it's the first finished project I've been a part of that has been published. The experience was nothing short of amazing, and it's left me buzzing with excitement for future projects."
    "Arabella, one of the characters you will meet on your journey, voiced by the talented Lauren Kong and brought to life through the stunning sprites by Podlet, holds a special place in my heart."
    "Her narrative within the haunted mansion resonates with me in profound ways, as I myself navigate the complexities of severe mental health issues. Mental health advocacy is a cause close to my heart, and it tends to reflect in my writing."
    "I strive to raise awareness about these critical matters while approaching them with the sensitivity they deserve."
    "Drawing from my background in psychology, I aim to provide an authentic representation of mental health issues, striving to shed light on these topics with compassion and understanding in my writing."
    "I must take a moment to express my deep gratitude to the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Their dedication and outstanding work have made this project truly exceptional."
    "I'm immensely thankful for their patience and support, which has been instrumental in my growth as a writer."
    "I'm a firm believer in the power of stories to inspire change and foster empathy. With \“The House On Limbo Lane\", I hope I have been able to contribute to the conversation on mental health while delivering an engaging and immersive experience."
    "Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey! Oh, and… Welcome to Limbo Lane!"

    "Hey ya'll"
    "First, thanks for taking a moment to read these!"
    "I'm Dagon Grey, a voice actor from deep south Alabama. I wrote and helped direct Herman's quest and was part of the voice for the Amalgam."
    "Originally I was going to play the voice of Herman myself, but after hearing Marlon's take on the character I was convinced (by my wife) that he had to voice him instead."
    "I've never written anything like this before, it was a huge challenge for me as all I've ever written is blurbs and sticky notes for D&D campaigns in the past."
    "I had a LOT of help from everyone else on the team, mostly Kylie the Audio Alchemist helped with directing, putting up with my inability to explain what my ears could perceive in audio and keeping organized,"
    "Elina the Art Wizard and Jan the Tunesmith for dealing with my not being able to make up my mind on changes."
    "Faust the Wordsmith worked hard to decipher my grammar and spelling for the quest, I'm sure all the while grinding his teeth at every unnecessary, additional, supplementary, excess, supernumerary punctuation,;...?"
    "Marlon had to rest his voice after one point during recording, oh the raw audio you'll never hear."
    "Teamwork is hard! Knowing when enough is enough is VERY hard (Kylie knows, don't you Kylie?). Limbo Lane was fun to make and I learned a great deal."
    "I would certainly do it again now that I have a better understanding of how this cat-herding thing works, so hopefully I'll be faster, and more efficient, next time."
    "Next time, NEXT TIIIIIIIIIME!!!"
    "P.S."
    "I hope those of you who like easter eggs find the few I scattered in the quest, cheers to those of you who didn't need the hint!"

    "In particular, I was responsible for the editing of Aures's, Herman's, and Lysander's quests. feel free to display their sprites!"
    "I loved working on this project! All of the characters are such a treat, and everyone on the team was very sweet and hardworking."
    "We had to scramble a bit in some places, but Michael and Kylie did a great job of keeping everyone chugging and picking up any slack they could."
    "It was really a wonderful team, and a great experience for my first time participating in the Spooktober Jam!"
    "Thank you to Michael and Kylie for their hard work; Maya, for coordinating editing with me; and Jett, Dagon, and Mint for being receptive to and flexible with my own work."

    "I came into this project with game-writing and tech experience, but knew after finishing my last Really Big Project in 2020 that gamedev wasn't something I could reasonably continue whilst also pursuing a career in voice acting."
    "I never lost my love for the medium, though—so, when approached about the possibility of writing just a portion of a title for Spooktober 2023, I absolutely jumped at the chance. I'm so glad to have (re)joined this merry band of misfits for what has always been my favorite jam of the year!"
    "If I were to thank folks individually, I'd probably end up detailing literally everyone on the team; you all are such wonderful artists to collaborate with, and I'm honored to have been alongside you all for the ride."
    "That said, I'd like to quickly extend my sincerest gratitude to the folks I can best describe as \“Team Lysander\"—to Michael, for assembling this goofy group, doing an incredible amount of work on the broader narrative, and pivoting between wearing so many hats;"
    "to Kylie, for your always-impeccable schedule management, stellar audio work, and willingness to play with my terrible, gooey noises;"
    "to Thoe, for artwork that legitimately made me cry multiple times (because you somehow managed to transport the Lysander from my brain into the real world);"
    "to Henri, for a score that more clearly encapsulated Lysander's interior energy than anything I could ever conceptualize; to Faust, for ensuring that my somewhat-unwieldy writing remained comprehensible to most humans;"
    "to Marie, for your continued willingness to collaborate and cross-check that our narratives properly interlinked; and to Xander, for your immense willingness to explore Lysander's headspace, for your trust in me and my goofy directions, and for giving your all in both the performance and audio-wrangling spheres."
    "Working with this team was an absolute joy, and I'm immensely proud of everyone for all their hard work. And, as for you, dear visitor—I sincerely hope you enjoyed your time with us on Limbo Lane!"
